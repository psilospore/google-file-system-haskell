# Google File System in Haskell

This is an example of GFS implemented in Haskell.
This is mostly for my own edumication and I was bored. This is not intended to be used in production.
I'm making it open source in case anyone else might be remotely interested.
This is a WIP and might be very wrong or I might skip steps.
